D = SELECT COUNT(*) FROM songs - A - B - C;

// The method I use is too generic, comparing danceability, energy and valence to the same value.
// A better way to do this is changing the values to be more specific. And you could also put the 'Artists' and 'Genres'
// That the person listens in the formula to decide their 'aura'. Deciding their 'aura' involves a lot of factors.
// My answer would be better if I put more factors(like 'artist' and 'genres') in the formula and be more precise in the boundaries of the 'aura'
