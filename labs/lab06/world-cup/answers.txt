Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Thought the growth would be linear in the beggining of the tests

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: A thousand, neither too small nor too big
